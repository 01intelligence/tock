//! System call interface for userspace processes.
//!
//! Drivers implement these interfaces to expose operations to processes.
//!
//! # System-call Overview
//!
//! Tock supports six system calls. The `yield` and `memop` system calls are
//! handled by the core kernel, while four others are implemented by drivers:
//!
//!   * `subscribe` passes a callback to the driver which it can
//!   invoke on the process later, when an event has occurred or data
//!   of interest is available.
//!
//!   * `command` tells the driver to do something immediately.
//!
//!   * `allow read-write` provides the driver read-write access to an
//!   application buffer.
//!
//!   * `allow read-only` provides the driver read-only access to an
//!   application buffer.
//!
//! ## Mapping system-calls to drivers
//!
//! Each of these three system calls takes at least two
//! parameters. The first is a _driver identifier_ and tells the
//! scheduler which driver to forward the system call to. The second
//! parameters is a __syscall identifer_ and is used by the driver to
//! differentiate instances of the call with different driver-specific
//! meanings (e.g. `subscribe` for "data received" vs `subscribe` for
//! "send completed"). The mapping between _driver identifiers_ and
//! drivers is determined by a particular platform, while the _syscall
//! identifier_ is driver-specific.
//!
//! One convention in Tock is that _driver minor number_ 0 for the `command`
//! syscall can always be used to determine if the driver is supported by
//! the running kernel by checking the return code. If the return value is
//! greater than or equal to zero then the driver is present. Typically this is
//! implemented by a null command that only returns 0, but in some cases the
//! command can also return more information, like the number of supported
//! devices (useful for things like the number of LEDs).
//!
//! # The `yield` system call class
//!
//! While drivers do not handle `yield` system calls, it is important
//! to understand them and how they interacts with `subscribe`, which
//! registers callback functions with the kernel. When a process calls
//! a `yield` system call, the kernel checks if there are any pending
//! callbacks for the process. If there are pending callbacks, it
//! pushes one callback onto the process stack. If there are no
//! pending callbacks, `yield-wait` will cause the process to sleep
//! until a callback is trigered, while `yield-no-wait` returns
//! immediately.
//!
//! # Method result types
//!
//! Each driver method has a limited set of valid return types. Every
//! method has a single return type corresponding to success and a
//! single return type corresponding to failure. For the `subscribe`
//! and `allow` system calls, these return types are the same for
//! every instance of those calls. Each instance of the `command`
//! system call, however, has its own specified return types. A
//! command that requests a timestamp, for example, might return a
//! 32-bit number on success and an error code on failure, while a
//! command that requests time of day in microsecond granularity might
//! return a 64-bit number and a 32-bit timezone encoding on success,
//! and an error code on failure.
//!
//! These result types are represented as safe Rust types. The core
//! kernel (the scheduler and syscall dispatcher) is responsible for
//! encoding these types into the Tock system call ABI specification.
